### Vision Statements
##### Executive Summary
Fake news is prevalent over the internet, especially on climate change and vaccinations. The online average readers do not have enough time and knowledge to identify false information.  InfoRoots uses automated information retrieval to fight against fake news and misinformation. Our web platform facilitates users to investigate online news and articles by providing analytic information about authors, publishers, and contents. By using InfoRoots, users will make accurate judgments on false information with small effort. 

##### Market Potential
Fact-checking is the traditional approach to intervene in fake news. Fact-checking websites provide analytic reviews of news and factual claims by using journalism experts. [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/), [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/), and [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/) are three mainstream fact-checking organizations, providing fact-checked articles on their websites. Instead of focusing on articles, [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/) generates professional reviews of online news sources and publishers. Users can use [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/)’s browser extension to check reviews of publishers when reading news and articles. Since professional fact-checking requires a large amount of time, they cannot cover every claim and article over the internet. Crowdsourcing and machine learning are relatively new approaches to this market. [Our.news](https://our.news/) is developing browser extension to provide readers both publishers’ information and crowdsourcing reviews. It is not effective due to a small user group so far. InfoRoots will be an innovative business based on machine learning in this market.

##### Stakeholders

InfoRoots has three groups of project stakeholders: team instructors, team members, target customers. First, team instructors consist of one professional supervisor and two teaching assistants. Their goal is to facilitate InfoRoots to successfully develop and launch. They offer the instructions of project management and provide feedback to every phase of the InfoRoots product. Second, team members consist of one project leader and three developers. Under the Scrum framework, the leader functions as both the project owner and Scrum Master, and three developers function as designers and programmers. The last but not the least, the target customers of InfoRoots are the average online readers who seek for investigating tools to identify fake news and articles that contains false information.
